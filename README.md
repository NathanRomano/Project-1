# Project-1

Data Analytics department were approached by the company's top management to solve a serious problem. For the past few years, Yellevate has been struggling with client disputes. Yellevate defines disputes as clients expressing dissatisfaction with the company's services and refusing to pay for them. This has been a huge financial burden for the company: statistically, nearly 20% of the disputes raised against Yellevate resulted in a payment opt-out. This has led to an approximate 5% annual loss of revenue (in USD). Management has now approached you and your team to help resolve the issue. Using data the company collected about these disputes, you will have to identify their causes and come up with actionable strategies to solve them. The analysis you present will be used by the company's top executives, so you need to absolutely make sure that you provide an exceptional report: after all, there are millions of dollars on the line.
